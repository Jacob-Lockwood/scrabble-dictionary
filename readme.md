# Scrabble Dictionary

There are a couple Scrabble dictionary websites already but I couldn't find any that allowed searching for words with a regular expression, so I made my own.

This is written in [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) using the [webua](https://github.com/uiua-lang/webua) module with <!-- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and --> [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

The file `out.css` is generated by TailwindCSS; to develop the site with Tailwind, [install the CLI](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest) to `tailwindcss` and run

```
./tailwindcss -i in.css -o out.css --watch
```
